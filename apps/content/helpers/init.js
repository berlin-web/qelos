	This is an example post for Qelos platform.<br>
	You can change it as you like, but this is a reference for you to create many more blog posts in the near future.

	While I'm writing those lines, there is no website or domain for this platform, so I can't help you with instructions.<br>
    I can only hope you cloned it from github, and you should find all the help you need inside thr readme.md files (there's one on each service).
</p><p>
This platform is separated to different services, each one is supposed to do one thing.<br>
Authentication service is responsible for the authentication mechanism and users, and can be used as a standalone for any other platform,
 so you can use it for a personal use.<br>
Content service is responsible for menus, posts, categories (and comments in the future).
<br>
Front Service is responsible for the client frontend and SSR, using Fastify-DX and Vue.<br>
The Admin Panel written in Vue and is located <a href="/app/" target="blank">/app</a>. :)
